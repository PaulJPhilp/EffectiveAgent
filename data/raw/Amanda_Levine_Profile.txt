### Summary  
I am an event producer with more than a decade of experience planning, managing, and delivering successful conferences, product launches, networking events, press briefings, and galas.  

I have produced events for corporations, non-profits, individuals, and charities such as the ALS Association. My charitable work has helped to raise over $200,000 through golf outings and cocktail party fundraisers for research into the treatment and cure for Lou Gehrig’s Disease.  

While always seeking to learn more and to develop myself, I have achieved high-level leadership, financial, communication, and interpersonal skills. I dedicate myself to delivering events to the satisfaction and delight of my clients.

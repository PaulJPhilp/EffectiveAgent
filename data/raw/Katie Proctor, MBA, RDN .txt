Summary
Katie is a self-motivated, entrepreneurial marketing and communications professional and food/nutrition expert. She is currently the U.S. lead for influencer marketing in the food, agriculture, and beverage sector for FleishmanHillard. She brings extensive experience in end-to-end influencer campaign management, consumer insights, and brand strategy for a variety of clients across the food value chain. She is particularly adept at leveraging the firm’s data-driven, audience-first approach to influencer marketing and activating influence as an integrated solution for both B2C and B2B in food and animal-related industries.
Katie returned to FleishmanHillard after spending many years in brand management and digital marketing for CPG companies, including a Fortune 500 company and a natural foods start-up. She is an intrapreneur at heart, regularly serving as an internal subject matter expert, tailoring programs and messages for a variety of stakeholders (grocery/retail, restaurant, farmer/producer, supplier, policymakers, etc.), and expanding CSR platforms. In 2017, she founded one of the first influencer-forward talent management agencies focused on food, nutrition, and lifestyle creators. She is a true connector and maintains deep relationships with key opinion leaders, credentialed experts, and digital influencers across industries.
Throughout her career, she has been quoted in top publications such as Fast Company, Elite Daily, USA Today, SHAPE, and Forbes on a variety of food, nutrition, and business-related topics.

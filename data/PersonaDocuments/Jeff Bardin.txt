Garrett Dale (Co-Founder, Chief Partnership Officer)
	•	March 31, 2010 - Garrett reported directly to Jeff
	•	"There are few colleagues throughout the course of your professional career that you can truly call a mentor – Jeff Bardin is one of them. Jeff is a natural leader who leads not only by what he says but what he does. His hard work, passion, and attention to detail trickles down (and even up) the ladder to all of his colleagues. He’s the guy who just makes things work, all while simply being an enjoyable person to work with. I strongly recommend him to any company as a boss, a colleague, and as a great all-around person."

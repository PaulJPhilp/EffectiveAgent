Summary
Dera Lee Productions is an award-winning event production and design agency that brings brand campaigns to life through an in-depth understanding of the event industry, theater arts, and marketing trends.
With a background in the theater arts, we believe events are all about storytelling. Our promise is that every event has the energy and ingenuity of opening night and the expertise of a 10-year run. Dera Lee Productions approaches every event like it's a Broadway show. Our years of experience mean that we know how to produce detailed, technically precise events that can transport the audience and even be a little magical. We balance the artistic and the technical to produce one-of-a-kind experiences that forge an emotional connection between attendee and brand.

She is incredibly professional, organized, communicative, and creative. We were happy with the final product and also the multi-month process leading up to the event.

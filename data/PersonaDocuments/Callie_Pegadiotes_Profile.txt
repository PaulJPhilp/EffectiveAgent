### Summary  
I am a seasoned brand marketer turned freelance experiential producer based in San Diego. I spent the first half of my career immersed in brand management and marketing and then transitioned into the production world, where I thrive most and am able to apply my experience of being on the client side to how we pitch and produce experiential events. I also freelance in the music world, managing AR onsite for major music festivals. I love collaborating, managing budgets, and multitasking. I do best in fast-paced environments and love being onsite.

## Overview

Welcome to the EffectiveAgent Framework Documentation! This document provides a comprehensive overview of the EffectiveAgent framework, including its core concepts, services, tools, pipelines, and testing. The EffectiveAgent framework is designed to empower developers to build and run AI agents with a focus on modularity and reusability.

## Core Concepts

A central concept in the EffectiveAgent framework is the **Pipeline**—a reusable component that encapsulates the logic for specific tasks (e.g., getting weather data or executing a ReAct loop). The **EffectiveAgent Runtime** then provides an intuitive API to execute these agents while abstracting away the underlying Effect‑TS operations and dependency management.

## Services

The EffectiveAgent framework includes several services that are essential for building and running AI agents. These services include:

- **EaLlmProvider:** This service is responsible for providing language model (LLM) capabilities to the framework.
- **EaToolExecutor:** This service is responsible for executing tools and returning their results.

## Tools

The EffectiveAgent framework supports a variety of tools, including:

- **Weather Tool:** This tool is used to get weather data.
- **Search Tool:** This tool is used to search for information online.
- **Calculator Tool:** This tool is used to calculate mathematical expressions.

## Pipelines

The EffectiveAgent framework supports several pipelines, including:

- **Weather Pipeline:** This pipeline is used to get weather data.
- **ReAct Step Pipeline:** This pipeline is used to execute ReAct loop steps.

## Testing

The EffectiveAgent framework includes several testing strategies to ensure the reliability and correctness of the framework and its components. These strategies include:

- **Unit Testing:** This type of testing is used to verify the correctness of individual components or modules of the framework.
- **Integration Testing:** This type of testing is used to verify the interaction between different components or modules of the framework.
- **System Testing:** This type of testing is used to verify the interaction between the framework and external systems.

## Conclusion

This updated guidebook now includes a navigable table of contents, a glossary with external links to key resources, and a dedicated reference section for hypothetical components. These additions should further help developers understand the framework structure and get up to speed with building robust AI agents using EffectiveAgent.

Happy coding!

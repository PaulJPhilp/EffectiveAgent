        //    Mock any tools that might be consulted during planning (e.g., to assess feasibility of a step).
        // 2. Act: Call the planning method of PlanningService with the goal.
        // 3. Assert: Verify the generated plan is a structured list of steps.
        //    Check if the plan logically addresses the goal based on the mock AI's output.

    // TODO: Add more unit tests for:
    // - Complex goals requiring multi-step plans.
    // - Scenarios where the AI might ask for clarification before planning.
    // - Error handling (e.g., AI fails to generate a plan, invalid goal).
    // - Plan validation or refinement logic if present in the service.

        // 1. Arrange: 
        //    - Define mock layers for AI models, tool registries, tool executors.
        //    - Compose these with the ReactPipelineServiceLive layer.
        //    - Prepare initial input (e.g., user query, chat history).
        // 2. Act: 
        //    - Construct and run the Effect program for ReactPipelineService.
        // 3. Assert: 
        //    - Verify the final output (e.g., agent's answer) after several ReAct iterations.
        //    - Check that mock tools were called as expected during the flow.
        expect(true).toBe(true); // Placeholder

    // TODO: Add more integration tests for:
    // - Different tool interactions and observation handling.
    // - Scenarios testing the limits (e.g., max iterations).
    // - Error propagation from dependent services.

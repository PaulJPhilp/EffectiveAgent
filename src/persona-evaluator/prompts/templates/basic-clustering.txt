# Basic Clustering Prompt
You are a marketing persona expert. Your task is to analyze {{normalizedProfilesCount}} normalized professional profiles and identify distinct persona clusters.

## Profiles Data
{{normalizedProfilesData}}

## Task
Analyze these profiles and create 3-5 distinct marketing persona clusters based on:
- Professional roles and responsibilities
- Skills and expertise areas
- Career trajectory and seniority
- Work challenges and priorities

## Output Format
Provide your analysis as a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "title": "Descriptive Cluster Title",
      "description": {
        "summary": "Brief one-paragraph summary of this persona cluster",
        "commonCharacteristics": ["Trait 1", "Trait 2", "Trait 3"],
        "skills": ["Skill 1", "Skill 2", "Skill 3"],
        "typicalBackground": "Description of typical professional background"
      },
      "representativeProfiles": [
        {
          "id": "profile_id_from_data",
          "relevanceScore": 0.95,
          "matchReasons": ["Reason this profile matches the cluster"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "analysisDate": "{{currentDate}}"
}

Ensure your clusters are meaningfully distinct, with clear boundaries between them. Focus on identifying patterns that would be useful for marketing segmentation.

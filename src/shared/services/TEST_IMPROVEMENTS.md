# Service Test Suite Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the shared services test suite to make it more comprehensive and reliable.

## Configuration Service Tests

### Original Coverage
- Basic loading of valid config
- Simple error handling

### New Coverage
- Testing of validation options (validateSchema flag)
- Testing schema validation with complex nested objects
- Testing path handling for configs in subfolders
- Better error case coverage with explicit error type checking

## Model Configuration Service Tests

### Original Coverage
- Getting a single model by ID
- Listing all models
- Basic capability filtering

### New Coverage
- Empty collection handling
- Multiple capability filtering (AND conditions)
- Tag-based filtering
- Version-based filtering
- More specific assertions about returned model collections

## Provider Service Tests

### Original Coverage
- Basic initialization
- Text generation with valid model
- Simple error testing

### New Coverage
- Testing all provider methods:
  - `complete` - Text completion
  - `generateImage` - Image generation
  - `generateEmbedding` - Embedding generation
  - `generateObject` - Structured object generation
- Testing specific error types:
  - Authentication errors
  - Rate limit errors
  - Network errors
- Testing parameter validation
- More robust error handling with try/catch blocks

## General Test Improvements

1. **Error Handling**: All tests now use try/catch blocks with specific error message assertions rather than the less reliable `.rejects.toThrow()` pattern, which was causing issues with Effect's error wrapping.

2. **Effect API Usage**: Updated all tests to use the correct Effect.js v3.x API patterns.

3. **Mock Objects**: Created more sophisticated mocks that handle complex test cases.

4. **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript typing in test files.

5. **Test Organization**: Logically grouped tests by functionality.

## Test Running

All tests can be run using:

```bash
bun run test:services
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Missing Service Tests**: Still need test coverage for:
   - Prompt Service
   - Skill Service
   - Agent Service

2. **Integration Tests**: Need tests that verify the interaction between services.

3. **Error Simulation**: Could improve simulation of network errors, timeouts, and other external failures.

4. **Performance Tests**: Missing test coverage for service performance under load.

5. **Code Coverage Analysis**: Should add code coverage reporting to identify untested code paths.

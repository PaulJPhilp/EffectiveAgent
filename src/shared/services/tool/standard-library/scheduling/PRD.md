# Scheduling Tool PRD

## Overview
A TypeScript-based scheduling tool that leverages Effect.ts Schedule Effect to provide 
a type-safe, composable scheduling system for recurring tasks and retries.

## Core Features

### 1. Schedule Types
- Fixed Interval Schedules
  - Run tasks at fixed time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes)
  - Support for milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours
  - Guarantee fixed spacing between executions
  
- Spaced Interval Schedules
  - Run tasks with delays between executions
  - Delay counted from task completion
  - Flexible for long-running tasks
  
- Retry Schedules
  - Exponential backoff
  - Fibonacci backoff
  - Maximum retry limits
  - Customizable retry conditions

### 2. Schedule Composition
- Combine multiple schedules using operators:
  - Union (either schedule)
  - Intersection (both schedules)
  - Sequence (one after another)
  
### 3. Task Management
- Type-safe task definitions
- Input/Output type validation
- Error handling and recovery
- Task cancellation support

### 4. Monitoring & Control
- Schedule status tracking
- Execution history
- Pause/Resume capability
- Runtime schedule modifications

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Core Implementation
- Effect.ts Schedule integration
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Proper error handling with Effect
- Immutable schedule definitions

### 2. Interface
```typescript
interface ScheduleConfig<In, Out> {
  readonly type: 'fixed' | 'spaced' | 'retry';
  readonly interval?: number;
  readonly maxAttempts?: number;
  readonly backoff?: 'exponential' | 'fibonacci';
  readonly onError?: (error: Error) => Effect<never, Error, void>;
}

interface Task<In, Out> {
  readonly execute: (input: In) => Effect<Out, Error, void>;
  readonly schedule: Schedule<Out, In, never>;
}
```

### 3. Integration
- Seamless integration with existing Effect-based systems
- Support for dependency injection
- Compatible with shared services architecture

## Success Metrics
1. Type Safety: Zero runtime type errors
2. Reliability: 99.9% schedule execution accuracy
3. Performance: < 1ms overhead per schedule evaluation
4. Memory: Constant memory usage regardless of schedule count

## Future Enhancements
1. Cron-style scheduling
2. Distributed scheduling support
3. Persistent schedule storage
4. Real-time schedule monitoring
5. Schedule visualization tools

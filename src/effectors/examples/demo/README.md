# Effector System Demo

This example demonstrates the core functionality of the Effector system by:

1. Creating a controller effector
2. Creating multiple counter effectors through the controller
3. Broadcasting commands to all counters
4. Monitoring state changes
5. Terminating effectors

## Running the Demo

```bash
bun run src/effectors/examples/demo/index.ts
```

## What it Demonstrates

- Effector creation and termination
- Message passing between effectors
- State management and updates
- Command broadcasting
- Event subscription and monitoring
- Proper cleanup and resource management

You are a professional marketer specialized in creating detailed persona profiles.

I'll provide you with a basic persona profile, and I need you to elaborate it into a comprehensive persona with a human-like name, detailed characteristics, motivations, goals, challenges, and more.

Basic Persona Information:
{basicPersonaData}

Please elaborate this basic persona into a comprehensive profile with the following elements:

1. Give the persona a memorable, human-like name that embodies their role, using alliteration or wordplay (e.g., "Marketing Maven Molly" or "Strategic Sam")

2. Provide a comprehensive description including:
   - Detailed role description
   - 3-5 core professional values
   - 3-5 key motivations
   - Description of how they make an impact in their organization
   - 3-4 specific professional goals with timeframes
   - EXACTLY 3-5 professional challenges they face (with impact descriptions)
   - EXACTLY 3-5 day-to-day operational problems (with frequency and severity)
   - Emotional profile (2-4 dominant emotions, 2-4 triggers, EXACTLY 3-5 professional fears)
   - EXACTLY 3-5 key success metrics they use (with importance level and measurement method)
   - Information ecosystem:
     * EXACTLY 3-5 professional influencers or thought leaders they follow
     * EXACTLY 3-5 trusted media sources they regularly consume (only using frequency values: "daily", "weekly", or "monthly")
     * 0-2 industry conferences they attend

3. Write a paragraph describing their professional personality traits and working style

4. Estimate their age range and average age based on career progression and experience level

Be creative but realistic - create a persona that feels like a real person in this professional role.

# Agent Runtime Service PRD

## Overview
The Agent Runtime Service is a TypeScript-based runtime environment for managing and executing agent activities in a controlled, stateful manner. It provides a robust infrastructure for creating, managing, and monitoring agent instances with built-in support for state management, activity processing, and error handling.

## Core Features

### 1. Agent Runtime Management
- **Creation**: Dynamic instantiation of agent runtimes with unique IDs and initial states
- **Termination**: Graceful shutdown of agent runtimes with proper cleanup
- **State Management**: Thread-safe state handling with atomic updates
- **Activity Processing**: Prioritized message processing with error handling

### 2. Communication Interface
- **Activity Sending**: Asynchronous activity submission to agent runtimes
- **State Querying**: Real-time state observation capabilities
- **Event Subscription**: Stream-based subscription to agent activities

### 3. Processing Pipeline
- **Prioritized Mailbox**: Message queue with priority handling
- **Workflow Processing**: Structured activity processing with state transitions
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error capture and propagation

## Technical Specifications

### Runtime States
```typescript
enum AgentRuntimeStatus {
    IDLE = "IDLE",
    PROCESSING = "PROCESSING",
    ERROR = "ERROR"
}
```

### Activity Types
```typescript
enum AgentActivityType {
    STATE_CHANGE = "STATE_CHANGE",
    COMMAND = "COMMAND"
}
```

### Performance Metrics
- Processing count
- Failure count
- Average processing time
- Last error tracking
- Status timestamps

## Architecture

### Service Layer
The service implements the Effect pattern for dependency injection and side-effect management:
- Pure functional approach
- Effect-based operations
- Referentially transparent computations

### State Management
- Thread-safe state updates via Effect Ref
- Atomic operations for consistency
- Real-time state tracking

### Message Processing
- Priority-based message queue
- Configurable queue sizes
- Non-blocking operations

## Error Handling

### Error Types
1. `AgentRuntimeError`: Base error type for runtime operations
2. `AgentRuntimeNotFoundError`: For invalid runtime ID access
3. `AgentRuntimeProcessingError`: For activity processing failures

### Error Recovery
- Automatic state updates on errors
- Error cause preservation
- Processing metrics updates

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Runtime
```typescript
const runtime = yield* AgentRuntimeService.create(
    "agent-1",
    initialState
)
```

### Sending Activities
```typescript
yield* AgentRuntimeService.send(
    "agent-1",
    {
        id: "activity-1",
        type: AgentActivityType.STATE_CHANGE,
        payload: newState
    }
)
```

### Subscribing to Events
```typescript
const events = yield* AgentRuntimeService.subscribe("agent-1")
```

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Efficient message processing
- Minimal memory footprint
- Non-blocking operations

### Monitoring
- Real-time status tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Error tracking and reporting

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. Enhanced command processing
2. Advanced state validation
3. Custom activity type support
4. Improved metrics and monitoring
5. State persistence options

### Potential Improvements
1. Distributed runtime support
2. Custom workflow processors
3. Advanced error recovery strategies
4. State snapshot and rollback capabilities

## Security Considerations

### State Protection
- Immutable state updates
- Controlled access patterns
- Type-safe operations

### Error Prevention
- Strong type checking
- Validation at boundaries
- Proper error propagation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual component testing
- Error case coverage
- State transition verification

### Integration Tests

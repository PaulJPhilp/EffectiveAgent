# OrchestratorService Design Document

## Overview
The OrchestratorService is a core service in the EffectiveAgent project that provides controlled execution of Effect-based operations. It acts as a central orchestrator for executing operations with policy enforcement, authentication, rate limiting, and audit logging.

## Core Features

### 1. Effect Execution
- Generic execution of Effect-based operations
- Retry mechanism with exponential backoff and jitter
- Configurable retry policies (attempts, delays, backoff)
- Abort signal support for cancellation

### 2. Policy Enforcement
- Token limit tracking and enforcement
- Operation type validation
- Policy-based access control
- Integration with PolicyService for rule evaluation

### 3. Authentication
- Auth context validation
- Role and permission-based access
- Pluggable auth validator interface
- Detailed auth error handling

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Request rate control per user/operation
- Configurable time windows and limits
- Minimum interval enforcement
- In-memory implementation with extensible interface

### 5. Audit Logging
- Execution lifecycle events
- Policy check results
- Auth validation events
- Rate limit checks
- Retry attempts

### 6. Error Handling
- Structured error types
- Detailed error messages
- Error cause tracking
- Retry-specific errors

## Implementation Details

### Service Pattern
```typescript
export class OrchestratorService extends Effect.Service<OrchestratorServiceApi>() {
  // Effect.Service pattern implementation
}
```

### Key Interfaces
1. `BaseExecuteOptions`: Configuration for execution
2. `AuthValidator`: Authentication validation
3. `RateLimiter`: Rate limit enforcement
4. `AuditLogger`: Audit event logging

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Cron Support (High Priority)
- Scheduled execution of effects
- Cron expression parsing
- Execution history tracking
- Schedule management (pause/resume/delete)
- Distributed locking for reliability

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- Model-specific rate limits from ModelService
- Distributed rate limiting support
- More sophisticated rate limit strategies
- Rate limit policy inheritance

### 3. Advanced Policy Features
- Dynamic policy updates
- Policy caching
- Policy composition
- Policy evaluation optimization

### 4. Monitoring & Metrics
- Performance metrics collection
- Resource usage tracking
- SLA monitoring
- Health checks

### 5. State Management
- Persistent execution state
- State recovery mechanisms
- State cleanup policies
- State versioning

### 6. Enhanced Auth
- OAuth/JWT support
- Role hierarchy
- Permission inheritance
- Session management

## Technical Debt & Improvements

### Code Quality
- Additional test coverage
- Performance benchmarks
- Documentation improvements
- API reference docs

### Architecture
- Consider extracting rate limiting to separate service
- Evaluate distributed execution support
- Review dependency injection patterns
- Consider event sourcing for audit logs

## Dependencies
- Effect: Core functional programming
- PolicyService: Policy enforcement
- AuditLogger: Event logging
- AuthValidator: Authentication
- RateLimiter: Rate limiting

## Usage Example
```typescript
const service = yield* OrchestratorService;
const result = yield* service.execute(myEffect, {
  auth: myAuthContext,
  rateLimiter: myRateLimiter,
  auditLogger: myAuditLogger
});
```

## Next Steps
0. Add metrics.
1. Implement cron support
2. Add model-specific rate limits
3. Enhance monitoring capabilities
4. Improve documentation
5. Add performance benchmarks
6. Consider distributed execution

## Conclusion
The OrchestratorService provides a robust foundation for controlled effect execution. With the planned enhancements, particularly cron support, it will offer a complete solution for both immediate and scheduled operations while maintaining security, reliability, and observability.

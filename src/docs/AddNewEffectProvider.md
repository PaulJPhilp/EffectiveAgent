1. Provider Client:
Implement a client that interfaces with the Google API for AI services (e.g., completions, embeddings).
This client should handle HTTP requests to Google's endpoints and provide necessary authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys or OAuth).

```export const GoogleClient = Context.Tag<GoogleClient>("GoogleClient");

export interface GoogleClient {
  sendRequest: (payload: RequestPayload) => Effect.Effect<GoogleResponse, Error>;
}
```

2. Tokenizer (Optional):
If Google's API requires tokenization or has specific token limits, implement a tokenizer for this provider.
The tokenizer ensures that the input text is split into tokens in a way that's compatible with Google's API.

3. Model Implementation (AiModel):
Build a new AiModel for Google by calling AiModel.make.
Define the following properties:
requires: The Google client dependency.
provides: The services your model provides (e.g., completions, embeddings).
cacheKey: A unique key for caching purposes.
updateContext: Logic to update the context with model-specific configuration.

```const GoogleModel = AiModel.make({
  model: "google-ai",
  cacheKey: Symbol.for("GoogleAiModel"),
  requires: GoogleClient,
  provides: Effect.map(
    makeGoogleCompletions(), // Custom logic for Google completions
    (completions) => Context.make(Completions.Completions, completions)
  ),
  updateContext: (context) => {
    return Context.merge(context, Context.make(GoogleClient, yourClientInstance));
  }
});
```

4. Completions Implementation:
Implement a module for completions, similar to OpenAiCompletions or AnthropicCompletions, that uses the Google client to handle requests and responses.

5. Integration with AiPlan:
If you want to use the Google provider in fallback or retry plans, integrate it into AiPlan alongside other models.

```
const googlePlan = AiPlan.fromModel(GoogleModel, { attempts: 3 });
```

To add a new provider, such as Google, you would need to implement its support as an `AiModel`. Here's a high-level overview of what you'd need to build:

---

### 1. **Provider Client**:
   - Implement a client that interfaces with the Google API for AI services (e.g., completions, embeddings).
   - This client should handle HTTP requests to Google's endpoints and provide necessary authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys or OAuth).

   **Example**:
   ```typescript
   export const GoogleClient = Context.Tag<GoogleClient>("GoogleClient");

   export interface GoogleClient {
     sendRequest: (payload: RequestPayload) => Effect.Effect<GoogleResponse, Error>;
   }
   ```

---

### 2. **Tokenizer** (Optional):
   - If Google's API requires tokenization or has specific token limits, implement a tokenizer for this provider.
   - The tokenizer ensures that the input text is split into tokens in a way that's compatible with Google's API.

---

### 3. **Model Implementation (`AiModel`)**:
   - Build a new `AiModel` for Google by calling `AiModel.make`.
   - Define the following properties:
     - `requires`: The Google client dependency.
     - `provides`: The services your model provides (e.g., completions, embeddings).
     - `cacheKey`: A unique key for caching purposes.
     - `updateContext`: Logic to update the context with model-specific configuration.

   **Example**:
   ```typescript
   const GoogleModel = AiModel.make({
     model: "google-ai",
     cacheKey: Symbol.for("GoogleAiModel"),
     requires: GoogleClient,
     provides: Effect.map(
       makeGoogleCompletions(), // Custom logic for Google completions
       (completions) => Context.make(Completions.Completions, completions)
     ),
     updateContext: (context) => {
       return Context.merge(context, Context.make(GoogleClient, yourClientInstance));
     }
   });
   ```

---

### 4. **Completions Implementation**:
   - Implement a module for completions, similar to `OpenAiCompletions` or `AnthropicCompletions`, that uses the Google client to handle requests and responses.

   **Example**:
   ```typescript
   export const makeGoogleCompletions = (): Effect.Effect<Completions.Completions, Error> => {
     return GoogleClient.sendRequest({ /* payload */ }).pipe(
       Effect.map((response) => parseGoogleResponse(response))
     );
   };
   ```

---

### 5. **Integration with `AiPlan`**:
   - If you want to use the Google provider in fallback or retry plans, integrate it into `AiPlan` alongside other models.

   **Example**:
   ```typescript
   const googlePlan = AiPlan.fromModel(GoogleModel, { attempts: 3 });
   ```

---

### 6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Ensure that the Google provider integrates seamlessly with the existing `AiChat` and `Completions` modules.
   - Test the provider for edge cases, such as API rate limits, large inputs, or invalid requests.

---

### Summary of Key Components to Build:
1. **GoogleClient**: Handles API interactions.
2. **Tokenizer (Optional)**: Handles tokenization if required by Google's API.
3. **GoogleModel (`AiModel`)**: Represents the Google provider as an AI model.
4. **Completions Module**: Implements completions logic using the Google API.
5. **Plan Integration (`AiPlan`)**: Enables fallback and retry logic.
6. **Testing**: Ensures the provider works with other modules like `AiChat`.

That's great to hear! I'm glad I could help. Feel free to come back anytime if you have more questions or need further assistance. Happy coding! ðŸš€

1. Caching
The library uses caching to avoid redundant computations or API calls, which can significantly improve response times and reduce costs when querying AI models.

Cache Key: Each AiModel has a cacheKey (e.g., modelCacheKey) that uniquely identifies the model or its configuration. This key ensures that repeated calls with the same inputs don't re-execute but instead reuse cached results.

Where It's Used:

In AiModel.make, the cacheKey is passed and can be utilized for caching completions or embeddings.
Cached results reduce latency and allow the library to respond faster to repeated queries.
Practical Impact: If you are adding a new provider (e.g., Google), you may want to implement caching for API responses so that repeated inputs don't unnecessarily consume API quota.

2. Concurrency
Concurrency is managed using semaphores to control simultaneous access to resources, such as API calls or shared state (e.g., chat history).

How It Works:

A semaphore is a synchronization primitive that limits the number of concurrent operations.
In AiChat, a semaphore is used to ensure only one operation (e.g., sending a message or streaming a response) modifies the shared history at a time.
Example:

```TypeScript
const semaphore = yield* Effect.makeSemaphore(1); // Allow 1 operation at a time
Where It's Used:
```

send Method: Ensures that updates to the message history are serialized to avoid race conditions.
stream Method: Manages access to the history and allows streams to be processed sequentially.
Practical Impact: If a new provider involves complex multi-step interactions or shared mutable state, you should use semaphores to avoid conflicts and ensure thread safety.

Why These Matter
Caching: Avoids redundant work, saves API calls, reduces latency, and improves scalability.
Concurrency: Prevents race conditions in shared resources, ensuring that concurrent calls (e.g., multiple chat threads) don't interfere with each other.
If you'd like, I can walk you through specific code examples related to caching or concurrency!

Yes, in this framework, if you start multiple completions at the same time, they will run on separate fibers. The library is built using the Effect-TS ecosystem, which is designed to be highly concurrent and leverages fibers (lightweight threads) for asynchronous operations.

Key Points About Concurrent Completions:
Separate Fibers for Each Completion:

When you initiate multiple completions (e.g., using AiChat.send, stream, or structured), each operation will be executed in its own fiber, allowing them to run concurrently.
This is possible because the Effect and Stream abstractions in Effect-TS are fiber-based.
Concurrency Control:

Although each completion runs in a separate fiber, the library uses semaphores to enforce controlled access to shared resources like history.
For example, if multiple completions attempt to update the shared chat history, the semaphore ensures that these updates are serialized to avoid race conditions.
Example with Effect.all:

You can explicitly run multiple completions concurrently using Effect.all or Effect.allPar (parallel execution):
```TypeScript
const completions = Effect.allPar([
  AiChat.send(input1),
  AiChat.send(input2),
  AiChat.send(input3),
]);
```

Scaling and Performance:

Since fibers are lightweight, you can scale concurrent completions efficiently without the overhead of traditional threads.
Summary:
Yes, multiple completions will run on separate fibers, allowing for true concurrency while maintaining thread safety through semaphores for shared resources. This ensures high performance and correctness in concurrent scenarios.

And it's the same for AiChat threads?
Yes, it's the same for AiChat threads. Each interaction (e.g., completions or streaming responses) in an AiChat thread runs in its own fiber. This design ensures that multiple operations can execute concurrently without blocking each other.

How This Works in AiChat:
Fiber-based Execution:

When a new message is sent (send method) or streamed (stream method), the operation is wrapped in an Effect or Stream.
These operations are run in separate fibers, allowing the library to handle multiple chat threads or interactions concurrently.
Concurrency Control:

While each operation runs on its own fiber, AiChat uses a semaphore to coordinate access to shared resources like the history (conversation context).
This ensures that updates to the shared history are serialized, avoiding conflicts or race conditions.
Practical Implications:

Multiple users or chat threads can interact with the same AiChat instance without issues.
Long-running or streaming responses won't block other threads from processing their requests.
Example:
If you start multiple completions in an AiChat thread:

```TypeScript
const completions = Effect.allPar([
  AiChat.send("What is AI?"),
  AiChat.send("Explain concurrency."),
  AiChat.send("What is Effect-TS?")
]);
```

Each send operation will run in its own fiber.
The semaphore will ensure that updates to the chat history are serialized.
This design makes AiChat threads highly concurrent and scalable, ideal for handling multiple simultaneous interactions.

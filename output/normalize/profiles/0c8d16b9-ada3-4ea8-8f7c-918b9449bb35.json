  "content": "To process the provided profile and return a normalized version, I'll follow the normalization instructions outlined in the task definition. Let's go through the steps:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Standardize capitalization, punctuation, and common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Normalize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Standardize skill names and group them into a consistent taxonomy.\n4. **Locations**: Format locations as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the input profile:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering abbreviations; Standardized company name punctuation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng\" was normalized to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF, California\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: \"Tech Solutions inc\" was standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n  - **Title**: \"Lead Software Eng\" was normalized to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and clarifications made during the normalization process.",

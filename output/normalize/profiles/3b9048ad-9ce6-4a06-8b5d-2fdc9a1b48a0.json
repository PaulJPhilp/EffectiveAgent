  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the specified guidelines for each field that requires normalization. Here's the process for normalizing the input profile:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain consistent hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names and abbreviations.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) or YYYY-MM for month-year combinations.\n\nLet's assume the input profile is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"Project Mgmt\",\n    \"AWS\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Project Management\",\n    \"Amazon Web Services\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized CA to full state name; Expanded abbreviations in job title and skills\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng.\" was normalized to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"San Francisco, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\", \"Project Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\", and \"AWS\" was expanded to \"Amazon Web Services\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: \"Tech Solutions Inc\" was standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n  - **Title**: \"Lead Software Eng.\" was normalized to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco Bay Area\" was standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and expansions made during the normalization process.",

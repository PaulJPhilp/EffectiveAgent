  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the outlined guidelines for each field that requires normalization. Here's how the process will work:\n\n1. **Company Names**: I'll ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: I'll standardize role titles, maintain hierarchy prefixes, and standardize department terms.\n3. **Skills**: I'll group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: I'll format locations as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize country names and abbreviations.\n5. **Dates**: I'll convert dates to ISO format and maintain \"Present\" for current positions.\n\nAdditionally, I'll add a `normalization_notes` field to document any significant changes or ambiguities.\n\nLet's proceed with normalizing the given profile:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF Bay Area\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"tech solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"June 2015\",\n        \"end_date\": \"February 2018\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 9 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2015-06\",\n        \"end_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 9 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Los Angeles, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF Bay Area to full city name; Expanded React.js to React; Standardized company name capitalization\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Lead Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF Bay Area\" was standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - \"tech solutions inc\" was capitalized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n  - Locations were standardized to include full city, state, and country names.\n  - Dates were converted to ISO format.\n\nThese changes ensure consistency and clarity across the profile data, making it suitable for downstream clustering and analysis.",

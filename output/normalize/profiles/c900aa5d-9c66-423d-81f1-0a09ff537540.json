Let's process the input profile step by step:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Dev\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Proj Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Steps\n\n1. **Company Names:**\n   - \"Tech Solutions inc.\" should be normalized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n\n2. **Job Titles:**\n   - \"Lead Dev\" should be expanded to \"Lead Developer\".\n   - \"Lead Developer\" is already standardized.\n\n3. **Skills:**\n   - \"Proj Mgmt\" should be expanded to \"Project Management\".\n\n4. **Locations:**\n   - \"SF, CA\" should be expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" should be expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates:**\n   - \"March 2018\" should be converted to \"2018-03\".\n   - \"Present\" remains \"Present\".\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Expanded SF to full city name; Standardized company name capitalization; Expanded job title and skill abbreviations.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name was capitalized correctly and \"inc.\" was changed to \"Inc.\".\n- The job title \"Lead Dev\" was expanded to \"Lead Developer\".\n- The skill \"Proj Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n- The location \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- Dates were converted to the ISO format where applicable.\n- A `normalization_notes` field was added to document the changes made during normalization.",

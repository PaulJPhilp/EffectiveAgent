  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the outlined normalization instructions for company names, job titles, skills, locations, and dates. Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, standardize punctuation, and resolve common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles, maintain hierarchy prefixes, and standardize department and function terms.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy, standardize skill names, and normalize specificity levels.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country,\" standardize country names and state/province abbreviations, and replace regional descriptions with specific locations.\n5. **Dates**: Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) where full date is known, use YYYY-MM for month-year combinations, and maintain \"Present\" for current positions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the input profile:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Lrn\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Learning\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded abbreviations in job title and skills\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes:\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer.\"\n- **Location**: \"SF, California\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States.\"\n- **Key Skills**: \"Machine Lrn\" was expanded to \"Machine Learning.\"\n- **Experience**: \n  - **Company**: No changes needed as it was already properly formatted.\n  - **Title**: \"Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Software Engineer.\"\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States.\"\n- **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03.\"\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to highlight key changes and expansions made during normalization.",

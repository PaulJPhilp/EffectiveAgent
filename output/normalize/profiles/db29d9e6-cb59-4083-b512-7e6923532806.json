  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, let's process the input profile step by step. Here's how we can approach the normalization:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization and standardization of company names.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize job titles by expanding abbreviations and ensuring consistent hierarchy.\n3. **Skills**: Normalize skill names and group them into a consistent taxonomy.\n4. **Locations**: Format locations as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format.\n\nLet's assume the input profile is as follows (replace `{input_profile}` with actual data if provided):\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. DevOps Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior DevOps Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Amazon Web Services\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded AWS to Amazon Web Services; Expanded CI/CD to Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. DevOps Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior DevOps Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF, California\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \n  - \"AWS\" was expanded to \"Amazon Web Services\".\n  - \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\".\n  - \"CI/CD\" was expanded to \"Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: \"Tech Solutions inc.\" was corrected to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThese changes ensure the profile data is consistent and ready for downstream processing.",

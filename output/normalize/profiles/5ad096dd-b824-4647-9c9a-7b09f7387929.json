Let's process the input profile step by step:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. DevOps Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"CI/CD Pipelines\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"tech solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Sr. DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Process\n\n1. **Company Names**:\n   - \"tech solutions inc\" → \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n\n2. **Job Titles**:\n   - \"Sr. DevOps Eng.\" → \"Senior DevOps Engineer\"\n   - \"Sr. DevOps Engineer\" → \"Senior DevOps Engineer\"\n\n3. **Skills**:\n   - \"AWS\" remains \"AWS\" (already standardized)\n   - \"Python Programming\" → \"Python\"\n   - \"CI/CD Pipelines\" remains \"CI/CD Pipelines\" (already standardized)\n\n4. **Locations**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" → \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n   - \"San Francisco Bay Area\" → \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n\n5. **Dates**:\n   - \"March 2018\" → \"2018-03\"\n   - \"Present\" remains \"Present\"\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior DevOps Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"CI/CD Pipelines\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded job title abbreviations; Standardized company name capitalization\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name was capitalized correctly and punctuation was standardized.\n- Job titles were expanded to their full forms.\n- Skills were checked for standardization, and \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\".\n- Locations were expanded to include full city, state, and country names.\n- Dates were converted to the ISO format where applicable.\n\nThis normalized profile should now be consistent and ready for downstream processing.",

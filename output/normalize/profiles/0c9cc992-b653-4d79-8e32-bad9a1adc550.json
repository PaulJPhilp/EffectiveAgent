Let's proceed with the normalization process:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"tech solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Global Tech\",\n      \"title\": \"Jr. Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"June 2015\",\n        \"end_date\": \"February 2018\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Los Angeles, CA\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Global Tech\",\n      \"title\": \"Junior Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2015-06\",\n        \"end_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Los Angeles, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering abbreviations; Standardized company names and job titles.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**: \n   - \"Sr. Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Lead Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Jr. Developer\" was expanded to \"Junior Developer\".\n\n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"Los Angeles, CA\" was expanded to \"Los Angeles, California, United States\".\n\n3. **Company Name Normalization**:\n   - \"tech solutions inc\" was capitalized and punctuated as \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n\n4. **Skills Normalization**:\n   - \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\".\n\n5. **Date Normalization**:\n   - Dates were converted to ISO format (e.g., \"March 2018\" to \"2018-03\").\n\n6. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added notes to explain significant changes and expansions made during normalization.\n\nThis normalized profile should now be consistent and ready for downstream processing.",

  "content": "To normalize the provided profile, I'll follow the guidelines outlined in the task definition. Let's process the input profile step by step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes consistently.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize country names and state/province abbreviations.\n5. **Dates**: Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) where full date is known, or YYYY-MM for month-year combinations.\n\nLet's assume the input profile is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Lrng\",\n    \"Project Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"tech solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Learning\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized location to full city and state name; Expanded abbreviations in job title and skills\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Company Name**: \"tech solutions inc\" was capitalized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n- **Job Titles**: \"Lead Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Lead Software Engineer\" and \"Sr. Software Eng.\" to \"Senior Software Engineer.\"\n- **Skills**: \"Machine Lrng\" was expanded to \"Machine Learning\" and \"Project Mgmt\" to \"Project Management.\"\n- **Location**: \"San Francisco, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\" and \"San Francisco Bay Area\" was standardized similarly.\n- **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03.\"\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and expansions made during normalization.",

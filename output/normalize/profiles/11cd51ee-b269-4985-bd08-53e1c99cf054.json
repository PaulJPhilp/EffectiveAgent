  "content": "To process the provided profile and return a normalized version, I'll follow the normalization instructions outlined in the task definition. Let's go through each field that requires normalization:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Standardize capitalization, punctuation, and common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) or YYYY-MM for month-year combinations.\n\nAdditionally, I'll add a `normalization_notes` field to capture any significant changes or ambiguities.\n\nLet's assume the input profile is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Proj Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering and management abbreviations\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng\" was normalized to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was simplified to \"React\", and \"Proj Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: Added a period to \"Tech Solutions Inc\" to standardize it as \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n  - **Title**: \"Lead Software Eng\" was normalized to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field captures the key changes made during the normalization process.",

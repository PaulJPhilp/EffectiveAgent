Let's process the input profile step by step:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Project Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Process\n\n1. **Company Names**:\n   - \"Tech Solutions Inc\" should be standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n\n2. **Job Titles**:\n   - \"Sr. Software Eng.\" should be normalized to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Software Eng.\" should be normalized to \"Software Engineer\".\n\n3. **Skills**:\n   - \"Project Mgmt\" should be standardized to \"Project Management\".\n\n4. **Locations**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" should be expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco Bay Area\" should be standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates**:\n   - \"March 2018\" should be converted to \"2018-03\".\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Expanded SF to full city name; Standardized job titles and skills abbreviations\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name was adjusted to include a period after \"Inc\".\n- Job titles were expanded to their full forms.\n- Skills were standardized for consistency.\n- Locations were expanded to include full city, state, and country names.\n- Dates were converted to the ISO format where applicable.\n- A `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and expansions.",

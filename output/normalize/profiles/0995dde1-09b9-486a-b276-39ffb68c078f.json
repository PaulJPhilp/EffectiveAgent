  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the guidelines, I'll need to process each field that requires normalization. Here's how the normalization will be applied to the input profile:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. DevOps Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior DevOps Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded DevOps abbreviation; Added period to company name\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**: \n   - \"Sr. DevOps Eng.\" was expanded to \"Senior DevOps Engineer\" to standardize the abbreviation and ensure consistency.\n\n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\" for clarity and consistency with the format \"City, State, Country\".\n   - \"San Francisco Bay Area\" was similarly standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n3. **Key Skills Normalization**:\n   - \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\" to match common skill naming conventions.\n\n4. **Experience Company Name Normalization**:\n   - \"Tech Solutions Inc\" was changed to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\" to standardize the company name format by adding a period after \"Inc\".\n\n5. **Dates Normalization**:\n   - \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\" to follow the ISO date format.\n\n6. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added a note to document significant changes and clarifications made during normalization.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency and standardization for better analysis and clustering.",

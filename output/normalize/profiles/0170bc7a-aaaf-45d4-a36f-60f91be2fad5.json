  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the specified guidelines for each field that requires normalization. Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: Format locations as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format and maintain \"Present\" for current positions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the input profile data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\",\n  \"location\": \"NYC, New York\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Mktg\",\n    \"Salesforce.com\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Mktg Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"January 2020\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York City\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n  \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Marketing\",\n    \"Salesforce\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME Corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2020-01\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized NYC to full city name; Expanded marketing abbreviations; Standardized company name capitalization.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\" was expanded to \"Senior Marketing Manager\".\n- **Location**: \"NYC, New York\" was standardized to \"New York, New York, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"Digital Mktg\" was expanded to \"Digital Marketing\", and \"Salesforce.com\" was standardized to \"Salesforce\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: \"ACME corp.\" was capitalized to \"ACME Corp.\".\n  - **Title**: \"Senior Mktg Manager\" was expanded to \"Senior Marketing Manager\".\n  - **Location**: \"New York City\" was standardized to \"New York, New York, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"January 2020\" was converted to \"2020-01\".\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and decisions made during the normalization process.",

Let's go through the normalization process step by step for the given input profile.\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\",\n  \"location\": \"NYC, New York\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Mktg\",\n    \"Salesforce.com\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Mktg Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"January 2020\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York City\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Process\n\n1. **Company Names**:\n   - \"ACME corp.\" should be normalized to \"ACME Corp.\" (proper case and standard abbreviation for \"corporation\").\n\n2. **Job Titles**:\n   - \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\" should be normalized to \"Senior Marketing Manager\".\n   - \"Senior Mktg Manager\" should also be normalized to \"Senior Marketing Manager\".\n\n3. **Skills**:\n   - \"Digital Mktg\" should be expanded to \"Digital Marketing\".\n   - \"Salesforce.com\" should be simplified to \"Salesforce\".\n\n4. **Locations**:\n   - \"NYC, New York\" should be expanded to \"New York, New York, United States\".\n   - \"New York City\" should also be expanded to \"New York, New York, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates**:\n   - \"January 2020\" should be converted to \"2020-01\".\n\n### Normalized Output\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n  \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Marketing\",\n    \"Salesforce\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME Corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2020-01\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized NYC to full city name; Expanded marketing abbreviations; Standardized company name capitalization.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name \"ACME corp.\" was capitalized correctly to \"ACME Corp.\"\n- Job titles were expanded and standardized to \"Senior Marketing Manager\".\n- Skills were expanded to full names where applicable.\n- Locations were expanded to include full city, state, and country.\n- Dates were converted to the ISO format where applicable.\n- A `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and standardizations made during the process.\n\nThis output maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency and standardization for further analysis.",

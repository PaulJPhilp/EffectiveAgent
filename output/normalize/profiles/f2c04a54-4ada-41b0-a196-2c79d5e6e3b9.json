  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I will process each field that requires normalization: company names, job titles, skills, locations, and dates. I will also add a `normalization_notes` field if necessary. Let's proceed with the normalization process.\n\n### Example Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Proj. Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering and management abbreviations; Standardized company name punctuation.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**:\n   - \"Sr. Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Proj. Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n\n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n3. **Skills Normalization**:\n   - \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\".\n   - \"Proj. Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n\n4. **Experience Normalization**:\n   - Company name \"Tech Solutions inc.\" was corrected to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n   - Job title \"Lead Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n   - Location \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - Date \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\n5. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added notes to explain the changes made for clarity and traceability.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency for analysis and clustering tasks.",

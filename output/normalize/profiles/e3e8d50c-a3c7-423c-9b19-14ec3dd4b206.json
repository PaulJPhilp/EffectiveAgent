  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the instructions outlined in the task definition. Let's go through the normalization process step by step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert all dates to ISO format.\n\nLet's assume the input profile is as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Node.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Eng\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Node.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodologies\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering abbreviations; Removed '.js' from React for consistency\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF, California\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\" for consistency.\n- **Company Name**: \"Tech Solutions inc.\" was corrected to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n- **Experience Title**: \"Lead Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Lead Software Engineer\".\n- **Experience Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency and standardization across all fields.",

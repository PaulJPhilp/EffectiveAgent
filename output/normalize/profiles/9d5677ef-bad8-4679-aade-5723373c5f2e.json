  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I'll follow the normalization instructions for each relevant field. Here's how the process would look for a given input profile:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"VP of Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Proj. Mgmt\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"VP Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"Feb 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Vice President of Engineering\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Project Management\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Vice President of Engineering\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Expanded VP to Vice President; Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded Eng. to Engineering\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**: \n   - \"VP of Eng.\" was expanded to \"Vice President of Engineering\" to maintain consistency and clarity.\n   \n2. **Location Normalization**: \n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\" for full location clarity.\n   \n3. **Skills Normalization**: \n   - \"Proj. Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\" for clarity and consistency.\n   \n4. **Experience Normalization**:\n   - Company name \"Tech Solutions Inc\" was standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\" with proper punctuation.\n   - Job title \"VP Eng.\" was expanded to \"Vice President of Engineering\" for consistency.\n   - Location \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - Dates were converted to ISO format: \"Feb 2018\" to \"2018-02\".\n\n5. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added notes to document significant changes and expansions for clarity.\n\nThis approach ensures that the profile data is consistent and ready for downstream processing, such as clustering and analysis.",

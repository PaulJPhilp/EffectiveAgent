  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data, I'll follow the specified guidelines for each field. Let's go through the normalization process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize titles, maintain hierarchy prefixes, and ensure consistency in department terms.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names and abbreviations.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format and maintain \"Present\" for current positions.\n\nNow, let's apply these rules to the input profile data:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Lrng\",\n    \"AWS\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Sr. Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Machine Learning\",\n    \"Amazon Web Services\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized location to full city and state name; Expanded 'Machine Lrng' to 'Machine Learning'; Expanded 'AWS' to 'Amazon Web Services'; Added period to 'Inc.' in company name.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"San Francisco, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"Machine Lrng\" was expanded to \"Machine Learning\", and \"AWS\" was expanded to \"Amazon Web Services\".\n- **Experience Company Name**: Added a period to \"Inc.\" for consistency.\n- **Experience Location**: \"San Francisco Bay Area\" was standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\nThese changes ensure consistency and clarity across the profile data, making it suitable for downstream analysis and clustering.",

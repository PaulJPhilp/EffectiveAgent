  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, we need to address each of the primary fields requiring normalization: company names, job titles, skills, locations, and dates. Let's go through the normalization process step-by-step for the given input profile.\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\",\n  \"location\": \"NYC, New York\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Mktg\",\n    \"Salesforce.com\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Mktg Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"January 2020\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York City\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Steps\n\n1. **Company Names:**\n   - \"ACME corp.\" should be normalized to \"ACME Corp.\" to standardize capitalization and punctuation.\n\n2. **Job Titles:**\n   - \"Sr. Marketing Mgr\" should be normalized to \"Senior Marketing Manager\" to expand abbreviations and standardize the title.\n   - \"Senior Mktg Manager\" should also be normalized to \"Senior Marketing Manager\" for consistency.\n\n3. **Skills:**\n   - \"Digital Mktg\" should be expanded to \"Digital Marketing.\"\n   - \"Salesforce.com\" should be standardized to \"Salesforce.\"\n\n4. **Locations:**\n   - \"NYC, New York\" should be expanded to \"New York, New York, United States.\"\n   - \"New York City\" should be standardized to \"New York, New York, United States.\"\n\n5. **Dates:**\n   - \"January 2020\" should be converted to \"2020-01\" in ISO format.\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Smith\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n  \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Digital Marketing\",\n    \"Salesforce\",\n    \"Content Strategy\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"ACME Corp.\",\n      \"title\": \"Senior Marketing Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2020-01\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 2 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"New York, New York, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized NYC to full city name; Expanded marketing abbreviations; Standardized company name capitalization and punctuation.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name \"ACME corp.\" was capitalized correctly to \"ACME Corp.\"\n- Job titles were expanded and standardized.\n- Skills were expanded to their full forms.\n- Locations were expanded to include full city, state, and country names.\n- Dates were converted to ISO format where applicable.\n- A `normalization_notes` field was added to document the changes made during normalization.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency for downstream processing.",

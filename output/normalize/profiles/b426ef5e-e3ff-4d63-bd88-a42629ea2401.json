Here's how the process will be applied to your input profile:\n\n### Example Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. DevOps Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco Bay Area\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior DevOps Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded DevOps abbreviation; Standardized company name punctuation\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**:\n   - \"Sr. DevOps Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior DevOps Engineer\" for consistency.\n   \n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco Bay Area\" was similarly expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n3. **Key Skills Normalization**:\n   - \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\" for consistency.\n   - \"AWS\" and \"CI/CD\" were left unchanged as they are already standardized.\n\n4. **Experience Normalization**:\n   - \"Tech Solutions inc.\" was corrected to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\" to standardize capitalization and punctuation.\n   - Dates were converted to ISO format: \"March 2018\" to \"2018-03\".\n\n5. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added notes to document significant changes and clarifications made during normalization.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency across all fields.",

  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the given guidelines, I'll need to process each field that requires normalization. Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles, maintain hierarchy prefixes, and standardize department and function terms.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy, standardize skill names, and normalize skills with different specificity levels.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country,\" standardize country names and state/province abbreviations, and replace regional descriptions with specific locations.\n5. **Dates**: Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) where full date is known, use YYYY-MM format for month-year combinations, and maintain \"Present\" for current positions.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the input profile. Since I don't have the specific input profile data, I'll provide a general template for how you would process it:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Node.js\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Node.js\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Removed '.js' from React for consistency\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr.\" was expanded to \"Senior.\"\n- **Location**: \"SF\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States.\"\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\" for consistency.\n- **Experience Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States.\"\n- **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03.\"\n\nIf you provide a specific input profile, I can demonstrate the normalization process on that data.",

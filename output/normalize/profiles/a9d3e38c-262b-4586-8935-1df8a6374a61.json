  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I will process each field that requires normalization and ensure the output adheres to the expected format. Let's go through the normalization process step by step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize titles, ensuring consistent hierarchy and terminology.\n3. **Skills**: Normalize skill names and group them into a consistent taxonomy.\n4. **Locations**: Format locations as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert dates to ISO format.\n\nLet's apply these steps to the provided input profile:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, California\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Java\",\n    \"Python Programming\",\n    \"Project Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"Feb 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Java\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 8 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering and management abbreviations\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Eng.\" was normalized to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n- **Location**: \"SF, California\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \"Python Programming\" was simplified to \"Python\", and \"Project Mgmt\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n- **Experience Company Name**: \"Tech Solutions Inc\" was standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\".\n- **Experience Title**: \"Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Software Engineer\".\n- **Experience Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Dates**: \"Feb 2018\" was converted to \"2018-02\".\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency for analysis and clustering.",

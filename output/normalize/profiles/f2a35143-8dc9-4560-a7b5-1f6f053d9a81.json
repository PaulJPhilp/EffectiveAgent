Here's how the process would look for a given input profile:\n\n### Example Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Dev. Ops Engr\",\n  \"location\": \"SF Bay Area, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"AWS\",\n    \"K8s\",\n    \"CI/CD\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions llc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Jr. Software Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"June 2015\",\n        \"end_date\": \"February 2018\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 9 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, CA\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Output Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Amazon Web Services\",\n    \"Kubernetes\",\n    \"Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions LLC\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead DevOps Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Junior Software Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2015-06\",\n        \"end_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 9 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF Bay Area to full location; Expanded abbreviations in job title and skills; Corrected company capitalization.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Company Names**: \n   - \"Tech Solutions llc\" was changed to \"Tech Solutions LLC\" to standardize capitalization.\n   \n2. **Job Titles**: \n   - \"Lead Dev. Ops Engr\" was expanded to \"Lead DevOps Engineer\".\n   - \"Jr.\" was expanded to \"Junior\" in the job title.\n\n3. **Skills**: \n   - \"AWS\" was expanded to \"Amazon Web Services\".\n   - \"K8s\" was expanded to \"Kubernetes\".\n   - \"CI/CD\" was expanded to \"Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment\".\n\n4. **Locations**: \n   - \"SF Bay Area, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates**: \n   - Dates were converted to ISO format (e.g., \"March 2018\" to \"2018-03\").\n\n6. **Normalization Notes**: \n   - Added a note to explain key changes and expansions made during normalization.\n\nThis process ensures that the profile data is consistent and standardized, making it suitable for clustering and analysis.",

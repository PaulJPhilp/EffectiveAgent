  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I will process each field that requires normalization: company names, job titles, skills, locations, and dates. Additionally, I will add a `normalization_notes` field to document any significant changes or ambiguities. Let's proceed with the normalization:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"VP of Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF Bay Area\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Proj.

Management' to 'Project Management'; Standardized 'React.js' to 'React'.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n- **Title**: \"VP of Eng.\" was expanded to \"Vice President of Engineering\" for clarity and consistency.\n- **Location**: \"SF Bay Area\" was standardized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n- **Key Skills**: \n  - \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\".\n  - \"Proj. Management\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n- **Experience**:\n  - Company names were checked for standardization; \"Tech Solutions, Inc.\" was already in a standard format.\n  - Job titles were expanded and standardized similarly to the main title.\n  - Locations were standardized to the full city, state, and country format.\n  - Dates were converted to ISO format (YYYY-MM).\n\nThis normalized profile should now be consistent and ready for downstream clustering and analysis.",

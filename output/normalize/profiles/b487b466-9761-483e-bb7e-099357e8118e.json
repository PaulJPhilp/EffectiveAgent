Let's process the input profile step by step.\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Machine Lrng\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Eng\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Machine Learning\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Expanded SF to full city name; Standardized job title abbreviations; Corrected 'Machine Lrng' to 'Machine Learning'\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**:\n   - \"Sr. Software Eng\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Software Eng\" in the experience section was expanded to \"Software Engineer\".\n\n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" in the experience section was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n3. **Skills Normalization**:\n   - \"Machine Lrng\" was corrected to \"Machine Learning\".\n\n4. **Date Normalization**:\n   - \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\".\n\n5. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added a note to document the changes made for clarity and traceability.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while improving consistency for analysis and clustering.",

  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I'll need to apply the normalization rules to each relevant field. Let's go through the process step-by-step:\n\n1. **Company Names**: Ensure proper capitalization, remove duplicate spaces, and standardize common variations.\n2. **Job Titles**: Standardize common role titles and maintain hierarchy prefixes.\n3. **Skills**: Group skills into a consistent taxonomy and standardize skill names.\n4. **Locations**: Format as \"City, State/Province, Country\" and standardize names.\n5. **Dates**: Convert all dates to ISO format.\n\nLet's apply these rules to the input profile:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Engr\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React.js\",\n    \"Agile Methodology\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engr\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"React\",\n    \"Agile Methodology\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years 7 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering abbreviations; Standardized React.js to React\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n\n- **Title**: \"Sr. Software Engr\" was changed to \"Senior Software Engineer\" to standardize abbreviations and maintain hierarchy.\n- **Location**: \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\" for full clarity.\n- **Key Skills**: \"React.js\" was standardized to \"React\" for consistency.\n- **Experience**:\n  - **Company**: Added a period to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\" for consistency with company naming conventions.\n  - **Title**: \"Lead Software Engr\" was changed to \"Lead Software Engineer\" to standardize abbreviations.\n  - **Location**: \"San Francisco\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n  - **Dates**: \"March 2018\" was converted to \"2018-03\" for ISO format compliance.\n\nThe `normalization_notes` field was added to document significant changes and clarifications made during the normalization process.",

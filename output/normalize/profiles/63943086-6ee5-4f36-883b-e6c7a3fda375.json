  "content": "To normalize the provided profile data according to the specified guidelines, I'll follow the normalization instructions for each relevant field. Here's how the process would look for a given input profile:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Sr. Software Eng.\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Proj. Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Eng.\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"February 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"March 2021\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 1 month\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"April 2021\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 6 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Remote\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Senior Software Engineer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Software Engineer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-02\",\n        \"end_date\": \"2021-03\",\n        \"date_range\": \"3 years 1 month\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Innovatech\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2021-04\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"2 years 6 months\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"Remote\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded engineering abbreviations; Preserved 'Remote' location as is.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes\n1. **Title Normalization**: \n   - \"Sr. Software Eng.\" was expanded to \"Senior Software Engineer\".\n   - \"Proj. Management\" was expanded to \"Project Management\".\n\n2. **Location Normalization**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" in the experience section was similarly expanded.\n   - \"Remote\" was preserved as is, since it is a valid location descriptor.\n\n3. **Company Name Normalization**:\n   - \"Tech Solutions Inc\" was standardized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\" with a period.\n\n4. **Date Normalization**:\n   - Dates were converted to ISO format (e.g., \"February 2018\" to \"2018-02\").\n\n5. **Normalization Notes**:\n   - Added notes to explain significant changes or decisions made during normalization.\n\nThis approach ensures that the profile data is consistent and ready for further analysis or clustering tasks.",

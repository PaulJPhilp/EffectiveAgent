Let's process the input profile step by step:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Assoc. Proj. Mgr\",\n  \"location\": \"San Fran, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Proj Mgmt\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc\",\n      \"title\": \"Assoc.

Proj. Mgr\" and \"Assoc. Project Manager\" should be normalized to \"Associate Project Manager\".\n\n3. **Skills**:\n   - \"Proj Mgmt\" should be normalized to \"Project Management\".\n   - \"Python\" and \"Data Analysis\" are already standard.\n\n4. **Locations**:\n   - \"San Fran, CA\" should be normalized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" should also be normalized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates**:\n   - \"Feb 2019\" should be converted to \"2019-02\".\n   - \"Present\" remains \"Present\".\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Associate Project Manager\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Project Management\",\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Analysis\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Associate Project Manager\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2019-02\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"4 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized location names; Expanded abbreviations in job title and skills; Corrected company name capitalization.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- The company name was capitalized correctly and the abbreviation \"inc\" was standardized to \"Inc.\"\n- The job title abbreviations were expanded to their full forms.\n- The location was expanded to include the full city, state, and country.\n- The date format was converted to ISO format for consistency.\n- A `normalization_notes` field was added to document the changes made during normalization.",

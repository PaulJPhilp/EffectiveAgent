Here's how we can process the input profile:\n\n### Input Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Dev\",\n  \"location\": \"SF, CA\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Sci\",\n    \"Project Mgmt\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"March 2018\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Normalization Steps\n\n1. **Company Names**:\n   - \"Tech Solutions inc.\" should be normalized to \"Tech Solutions Inc.\"\n\n2. **Job Titles**:\n   - \"Lead Dev\" should be normalized to \"Lead Developer\".\n\n3. **Skills**:\n   - \"Data Sci\" should be normalized to \"Data Science\".\n   - \"Project Mgmt\" should be normalized to \"Project Management\".\n\n4. **Locations**:\n   - \"SF, CA\" should be normalized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n   - \"San Francisco\" should be normalized to \"San Francisco, California, United States\".\n\n5. **Dates**:\n   - \"March 2018\" should be converted to \"2018-03\".\n   - \"Present\" remains \"Present\".\n\n### Normalized Profile\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n  \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n  \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\",\n  \"key_skills\": [\n    \"Python\",\n    \"Data Science\",\n    \"Project Management\"\n  ],\n  \"experience\": [\n    {\n      \"company\": \"Tech Solutions Inc.\",\n      \"title\": \"Lead Developer\",\n      \"duration\": {\n        \"start_date\": \"2018-03\",\n        \"end_date\": \"Present\",\n        \"date_range\": \"5 years\"\n      },\n      \"location\": \"San Francisco, California, United States\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"normalization_notes\": \"Standardized SF to full city name; Expanded abbreviations for job title and skills; Standardized company name punctuation.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Company Name**: \"Tech Solutions inc.\" was capitalized correctly and \"inc.\" was standardized to \"Inc.\"\n- **Job Title**: \"Lead Dev\" was expanded to \"Lead Developer\" for clarity and consistency.\n- **Skills**: Abbreviations like \"Data Sci\" and \"Project Mgmt\" were expanded to their full forms.\n- **Location**: \"SF, CA\" was expanded to \"San Francisco, California, United States\" for clarity.\n- **Dates**: The date format was converted to ISO format for consistency.\n\nThis normalized profile maintains the semantic meaning of the original data while ensuring consistency and clarity for downstream processing.",

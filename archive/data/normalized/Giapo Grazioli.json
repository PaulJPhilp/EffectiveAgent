  "bio": "Haere Mai, my name is Giapo Grazioli, I am the chef and patron at Giapo Ice Cream. During these years running the kitchen at Giapo I saw that Ice Cream had the potential to be more expressive than what it had been so far. In my mind ice cream had to carry a different narrative. I focused my kitchen work on mashing up ideas from all the humanities including technology, art and science. I am currently doing scientific research with AUT and Otago University. I run a blog where I write about my kitchen observations and I am the co-author of a few published peer-reviewed papers. Come down to Giapo Ice Cream to try one of my creations at 12 Gore St, Auckland, New Zealand. To find out more visit: www.giapo.com"

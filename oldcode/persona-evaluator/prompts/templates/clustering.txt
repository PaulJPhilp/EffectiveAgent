# Clustering Prompt
You are a marketing persona specialist. Your task is to analyze a set of normalized profiles and create basic persona clusters.

## Normalized Profiles
There are {{normalizedProfilesCount}} normalized profiles to analyze:

{{normalizedProfilesData}}

## Task
Analyze these profiles and create 3-7 distinct persona clusters. Each cluster should represent a meaningful segment of the audience.

For each cluster:
1. Identify common patterns in demographics, behaviors, and attitudes
2. Create a descriptive title that captures the essence of the cluster
3. Write a brief description of the cluster
4. List key characteristics that define this cluster
5. Include representative quotes that illustrate the cluster's perspective

## Output Format
Provide your clusters as a valid JSON object with this structure:
{
  "clusters": [
    {
      "title": "Descriptive Cluster Title",
      "description": "Brief description of this persona cluster",
      "characteristics": [
        "Key characteristic 1",
        "Key characteristic 2",
        "Key characteristic 3"
      ],
      "representativeQuotes": [
        "Quote that illustrates this persona's perspective",
        "Another representative quote"
      ],
      "profileIds": [1, 5, 8]
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "Brief analysis of the clustering results"
}

Ensure each cluster is distinct and represents a meaningful segment of the audience.

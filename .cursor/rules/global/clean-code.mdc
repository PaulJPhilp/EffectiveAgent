# Clean Code Guidelines

## Project Setup
- Use Bun as the package manager for all dependency management and script execution. Do not use npm or yarn.

## Anti-patterns
- Do not use non-null assertions (!).

# Functions & Logic
- Keep functions short and single-purpose (<20 lines).
- Avoid deeply nested blocks by:
- Use early returns.
- Extract logic into utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce) to simplify logic.
- Use arrow functions for simple cases (<3 instructions), named functions otherwise.
- Use default parameter values instead of null/undefined checks.
- Use RO-RO (Receive Object, Return Object) for passing and returning multiple parameters.

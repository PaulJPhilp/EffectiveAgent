# Task 6.2: Project Documentation (Implementation)

**Goal:**

Create clear and concise documentation for both the data generator and the frontend application to make the project easy to understand, use, and maintain.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Create a Root `README.md`:**
    *   In the root of the `architecture-explorer` project, create a `README.md` file.
    *   This file should provide a high-level overview of the project, explaining its purpose and how the two main parts (generator and explorer) work together.
    *   Include a "Getting Started" section that explains how to install dependencies (`bun install`) and run the generator and the frontend application.
2.  **Document the Generator:**
    *   Create a `README.md` file inside `packages/architecture-generator`.
    *   Explain what the generator does and how to run it (`bun run generate`).
    *   Document the supported JSDoc tags (`@architectureComponent`, `@c4`, etc.) and what they are used for. Provide a clear example.
3.  **Document the Frontend:**
    *   Create a `README.md` file inside `apps/architecture-explorer`.
    *   Explain how to run the frontend application in development mode (`bun run dev`).
    *   Briefly describe the main interactive features (clicking nodes, filtering by tags).

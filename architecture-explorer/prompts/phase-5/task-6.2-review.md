# Task 6.2: Project Documentation (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the agent has produced clear, accurate, and comprehensive documentation for the project.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Review Root `README.md`:**
    *   Open the `README.md` file in the project root.
    *   Read through it to ensure it provides a good high-level summary.
    *   Check that the instructions for installation and running the apps are correct and easy to follow.
2.  **Review Generator `README.md`:**
    *   Open `packages/architecture-generator/README.md`.
    *   Confirm that the explanation of the JSDoc tags is clear and that the example is helpful.
3.  **Review Frontend `README.md`:**
    *   Open `apps/architecture-explorer/README.md`.
    *   Ensure the instructions for running the development server are correct.
4.  **Overall Quality Check:**
    *   Read all documentation from the perspective of a new developer joining the project. Is it easy to understand what the project is for and how to get it running? Is anything confusing or missing?

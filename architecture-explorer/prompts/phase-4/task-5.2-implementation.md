# Task 5.2: Error Handling & Diagnostics (Implementation)

**Goal:**

Improve the robustness of the data generator by adding structured error handling and diagnostic logging.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Implement Error Handling:**
    *   Throughout the generator's modules (`JSDocParser`, `RelationshipInferrer`, etc.), add `try...catch` blocks or use a functional error handling approach (like returning a result object `{ success: true, data: ... } | { success: false, error: ... }`) to gracefully handle potential issues.
    *   Examples of errors to handle:
        *   A source file cannot be found or parsed.
        *   A JSDoc comment is missing a required tag (e.g., `@architectureComponent`).
        *   An imported module cannot be resolved.
2.  **Add Diagnostic Logging:**
    *   Instead of crashing, the generator should log informative error and warning messages to the console.
    *   For example, if a component is missing a `@description` tag, log a warning but continue processing other components.
    *   If a file fails to parse entirely, log an error and skip that file.
3.  **Refine the Main Script:**
    *   Update the main `index.ts` script to check for failures from the different modules and decide whether to continue or exit.
    *   The script should exit with a non-zero status code if critical errors occurred, which is useful for CI/CD pipelines.

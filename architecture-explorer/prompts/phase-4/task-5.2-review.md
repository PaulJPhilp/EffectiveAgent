# Task 5.2: Error Handling & Diagnostics (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the generator can now handle common errors gracefully without crashing and provides useful diagnostic output.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Introduce Errors in Test Data:**
    *   Create a new malformed test file or modify an existing one. For example:
        *   Remove the `@architectureComponent` tag from one component.
        *   Add an `import` statement that points to a non-existent file.
        *   Add a file with syntax errors.
2.  **Review Code:**
    *   Inspect the generator's modules to confirm that error handling has been added around parsing and analysis logic.
    *   Check that informative messages are being logged for different error conditions.
3.  **Execute the Script:**
    *   Navigate to the `packages/architecture-generator` directory.
    *   Run `bun run generate`.
4.  **Validate Output:**
    *   The script should not crash. Instead, it should complete its run.
    *   The console should display clear error or warning messages corresponding to the issues you introduced in the test data.
    *   The final `architecture.json` should still be generated, containing all the components that were successfully parsed.

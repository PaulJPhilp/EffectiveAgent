# Task 3.3: Data Loading & Initial Visualization (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the application correctly fetches the `architecture.json` file and renders the architectural diagram from its data.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Check Data File Location:**
    *   Confirm that `architecture.json` is present in `apps/architecture-explorer/public`.
2.  **Review App Component:**
    *   Open `src/App.tsx`. It should now contain a `useEffect` hook to fetch the JSON data.
    *   It should use `useState` to manage the loaded data, as well as loading and error states.
    *   It should pass the diagram definition from the fetched data to the `DiagramCanvas` component.
3.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Navigate to the `apps/architecture-explorer` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run the command: `bun run dev`.
4.  **Validate in Browser:**
    *   Open the local development URL in your browser.
    *   The page should initially show a loading message, and then display the architectural diagram defined in your `architecture.json` file. This diagram should show the `SampleComponent` and `ImporterComponent` with a dependency arrow between them.

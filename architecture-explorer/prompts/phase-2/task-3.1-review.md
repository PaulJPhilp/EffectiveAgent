# Task 3.1: Basic React App Setup (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the agent has correctly set up the foundational structure for the React frontend application.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Check File Structure:**
    *   Navigate to the `apps/architecture-explorer` directory.
    *   Confirm the existence of the following files and directories:
        *   `index.html`
        *   `vite.config.ts`
        *   `tsconfig.json`
        *   `src/main.tsx`
        *   `src/App.tsx`
2.  **Review Configuration:**
    *   Open `vite.config.ts` and ensure the React plugin is correctly configured.
    *   Open `tsconfig.json` and check for standard React/TypeScript settings.
3.  **Review Component Code:**
    *   Check `src/main.tsx` to ensure it's correctly rendering the `App` component.
    *   Check `src/App.tsx` to ensure it's a basic React component that renders some placeholder content.
4.  **Run the Application:**
    *   Navigate to the `apps/architecture-explorer` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run the command: `bun run dev`.
5.  **Validate in Browser:**
    *   Open the local development URL provided by Vite in your browser.
    *   The page should load without errors and display the content from your `App.tsx` component (e.g., the "Architecture Explorer" heading).

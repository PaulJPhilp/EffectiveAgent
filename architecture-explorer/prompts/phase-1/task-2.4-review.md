# Task 2.4: Architecture Model & JSON Output (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the agent has correctly implemented the final step of the data generation pipeline, producing a valid `architecture.json` file.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Check for New Modules:**
    *   Confirm that `packages/architecture-generator/src/ArchitectureModelBuilder.ts` and `packages/architecture-generator/src/JsonSerializer.ts` exist.
2.  **Review Logic:**
    *   Inspect `ArchitectureModelBuilder.ts` to ensure it correctly assembles the `NodeData` and `EdgeData` into the `ArchitectureData` structure.
    *   Inspect `JsonSerializer.ts` to ensure it correctly writes the given object to a file as JSON.
3.  **Review Main Script:**
    *   Open `packages/architecture-generator/src/index.ts`. It should now represent a clean pipeline, calling the various modules in the correct order: JSDoc Parser -> Relationship Inferrer -> Model Builder -> JSON Serializer.
    *   Confirm that all intermediate `console.log` statements have been removed.
4.  **Execute the Script:**
    *   Navigate to the `packages/architecture-generator` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run the command: `bun run generate`.
5.  **Validate Output:**
    *   Check the root directory of the `architecture-explorer` project for a new file named `architecture.json`.
    *   Confirm that `ajv` is added as a dependency in `packages/architecture-generator/package.json`.
    *   Verify that the script imports the `architecture.schema.json` and uses `ajv` to validate the data object **before** it is serialized and written to the file.
    *   Confirm that the script combines the nodes, edges, and Mermaid string into a single object that matches the `ArchitectureData` interface from `types.ts`.
    *   It must contain two nodes (for `SampleComponent` and `ImporterComponent`) and one edge representing the dependency between them.

# Task 2.2: JSDoc-Based Metadata Extraction (Review)

**Goal:**

Verify that the agent has correctly implemented the JSDoc parsing logic to extract architectural metadata from a source file.

**Verification Steps:**

1.  **Check for New Module:**
    *   Confirm that the file `packages/architecture-generator/src/JSDocParser.ts` exists.
2.  **Review Parser Logic:**
    *   Open `JSDocParser.ts`.
    *   Review the parsing function. It should correctly identify and extract the string values associated with the `@c4`, `@description`, and `@groupByLayer` tags. It should also handle the potentially multi-valued `@tag` tag correctly (e.g., into an array).
    *   The function should confirm the presence of the `@architectureComponent` tag, as this identifies the class as a component to be processed.
3.  **Review Main Script:**
    *   Open `packages/architecture-generator/src/index.ts`.
    *   Ensure it now imports and calls the function from `JSDocParser.ts` with the class node.
    *   Confirm that it logs the returned metadata object.
4.  **Execute the Script:**
    *   Navigate to the `packages/architecture-generator` directory in your terminal.
    *   Run the command: `bun run generate`.
5.  **Validate Output:**
    *   Check the console output. It should display a JavaScript object containing the metadata extracted from `sample.ts`, for example:
        ```json
        {
          "id": "SampleComponent",
          "name": "SampleComponent",
          "c4Level": "System",
          "description": "A sample component for testing the generator.",
          "tags": ["sample"],
          "layer": "Core"
        }
        ```

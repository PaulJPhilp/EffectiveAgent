# Architecture Explorer: Technology Stack

This document outlines the core technologies and libraries selected for the development of the Architecture Explorer, divided by its two main components: the Architectural Data Generator and the Architecture Explorer Frontend.

---

## 1. Architectural Data Generator

This component is responsible for parsing your codebase, extracting architectural information, and generating the structured data for the frontend.

*   **Core Language:** **TypeScript**
    *   *Reason:* Strong typing, excellent developer tooling, and native compatibility with your existing codebase.
*   **AST Parsing Library:** **`ts-morph`**
    *   *Reason:* Provides a powerful, ergonomic, and object-oriented API for interacting with the TypeScript compiler's Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). This enables accurate and robust extraction of code structure, JSDoc metadata, and relationships.

## 2. Architecture Explorer Frontend

This is the interactive web application that consumes the generated data and visualizes the architecture.

*   **Frontend Framework:** **React**
    *   *Reason:* Component-based architecture, extensive ecosystem, and your familiarity, making it ideal for building complex and interactive user interfaces.
*   **Build Tool:** **Vite**
    *   *Reason:* Offers an extremely fast development server (powered by esbuild) and optimized production builds, ensuring a smooth and efficient developer experience.
*   **Diagram Rendering Library:** **`mermaid.js`**
    *   *Reason:* The core library for converting text-based diagram definitions (generated by the data generator) into interactive SVG visualizations.
*   **Styling Framework:** **Tailwind CSS v4**
    *   *Reason:* A utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development, promotes design consistency through constrained values, and integrates seamlessly with React components.
*   **UI Component Library:** **Shadcn UI**
    *   *Reason:* Provides a collection of high-quality, customizable, and accessible UI components built on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. This significantly accelerates UI development and ensures a polished, consistent user experience.
*   **State Management:** **React Hooks (`useState`, `useContext`)** (with potential for **Zustand**)
    *   *Reason:* For V1, React's built-in hooks are sufficient for managing application state. Zustand offers a lightweight and flexible alternative if global state complexity increases.
*   **Data Consumption:** **Direct JSON Import**
    *   *Reason:* For V1, the generated JSON data will be bundled directly into the frontend application. This simplifies initial setup by avoiding network requests or a separate backend API.

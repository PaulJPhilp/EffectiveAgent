# Vercel AI Provider Rules

## LLM Call Execution

- **Never call the Vercel AI SDK (or any LLM API) directly to execute a completion or other operation.**
- All LLM calls must be wrapped in an `Effect` and exposed via the provider service.
- Only the executive service (or pipeline runner) may execute these Effects.
- This ensures composability, testability, and separation of concerns.

## Configuration Alignment for Persona-Generator Agent

### Overview
This document outlines the strategy to align the configuration of the persona-generator agent with the established pattern seen in the normalizing agent. The goal is to ensure consistency in configuration file structure, schema validation, and overall initialization process across agents.

### Current Differences
- **Configuration Structure:** The persona-generator agent may have a less standardized configuration compared to the normalizing agent which uses dedicated JSON files (e.g., `providers.json`, `models.json`, `tasks.json`).
- **Schema Validation:** The normalizing agent employs strict JSON schema validation, while the persona-generator agent might not enforce similar checks.
- **Initialization Parameters:** Differences in how run IDs, directory structures, and state updates are handled.

### Alignment Steps
1. **Standardize Configuration Files:**
   - Adopt JSON schemas similar to those used in the normalizing agent for providers, models, and tasks.
   - Ensure that configurations are validated against these schemas at startup.
2. **Consistent Initialization Patterns:**
   - Generate unique run IDs using an ISO timestamp combined with random characters.
   - Set up run directories in a consistent manner (e.g., using a dedicated helper function).
   - Maintain clear state transitions (e.g., setting status to 'loading' during initialization).
3. **Error Handling and Dependency Injection:**
   - Implement early return patterns for error cases.
   - Utilize dependency injection to make configuration loading and error handling testable and modular.

### Next Steps for Implementation
- **Analysis:** Review the current configuration and initialization code in the persona-generator agent to identify specific deviations.
- **Mapping:** Create a mapping document to detail how existing configurations will be transformed to match the new schema.
- **Incremental Updates:** Plan small, non-disruptive changes to gradually align the persona-generator configuration with the normalizing agent pattern.

### Conclusion
This document is a foundational step towards achieving configuration consistency across agents. It will serve as a reference in subsequent refactoring steps, ensuring that the persona-generator agent adheres to the best practices already implemented in the normalizing agent.

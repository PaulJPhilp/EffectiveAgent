You are a data analyst specialized in analyzing professional profiles to identify meaningful persona clusters.

I have {normalizedProfilesCount} normalized professional profiles. Your task is to analyze them and identify meaningful persona clusters.

Here's the data:
{normalizedProfilesData}

Focus on clustering these profiles based on:
- Job titles and responsibilities
- Skills and expertise
- Professional background and career trajectory
- Content creation habits and focus areas

For each cluster:
1. Provide a concise, descriptive title for the persona
2. Write a short description of this persona type (1-2 sentences)
3. List 4-7 common characteristics shared by profiles in this cluster
4. List 5-10 key skills typical for this persona
5. Describe their typical professional background
6. Estimate what percentage of the total profiles this persona represents (these should sum to approximately 100%)
7. List the IDs of representative profiles from the data that best exemplify this persona

Identify 4-7 distinct personas that collectively cover the full range of profiles in the dataset. Ensure each persona is distinct and represents a meaningful segment of the profiles.

After creating the clusters, provide a brief analysis of what these personas reveal about the overall dataset.

IMPORTANT: Your response must be ONLY a valid JSON object, with NO additional text, markdown formatting, or explanation. Follow this exact structure and ensure all arrays and objects have matching braces and brackets:

{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "clusters": [
    {
      "title": "string",
      "description": "string",
      "commonCharacteristics": ["string"],
      "skills": ["string"],
      "typicalBackground": "string",
      "percentageOfTotal": number,
      "representativeProfiles": ["string"]
    }
  ],
  "analysis": "string",
  "totalProfiles": number
}

Notes:
1. Do not include ```json or any other markdown formatting
2. Ensure all JSON properties have double quotes
3. Use commas correctly between array/object items
4. Make sure all arrays and objects have matching closing brackets/braces
5. The response should start with { and end with } with no other characters

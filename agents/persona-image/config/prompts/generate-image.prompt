# Profile Data Normalization
    ## Task Definition\nYou are tasked with normalizing professional profile data to improve consistency\nfor downstream clustering and analysis. You will receive a JSON profile that follows\nthe ProfileData schema, and you must return a normalized version with standardized\nvalues for company names, job titles, skills, locations, and dates.

## Input Data Structure
Each profile contains personal information, skills, contact details, certificates, and work experience. The primary fields requiring normalization are:
- \`title\` (job title)
- \`location\`
- \`key_skills\` (array of skills)
- \`experience\` (array of work experiences, each containing):
  - \`company\` (company name)
  - \`title\` (job title)
  - \`duration.start_date\` and \`duration.end_date\` (dates)
  - \`location\` (work location)

## Normalization Instructions

### 1. Company Names (Highest Priority)
- Convert to standard capitalization (proper case for most names, preserve well-known acronyms)
- Remove duplicate spaces and standardize punctuation
- Standardize common variations (e.g.,
    "Inc." vs "Incorporated")
- Examples:
  - "CHANEL" → "Chanel" (unless officially all caps)
  - "Self-employed" → "Self-Employed"
  - "FleishmanHillard" → "Fleishman-Hillard"
  - "LUME studios" → "LUME Studios"

### 2. Job Titles
- Standardize common role titles (e.g., normalize "Sr.",
    "Senior",
    "Sr")
- Maintain hierarchy prefixes consistently (e.g.,
    "Senior",
    "Lead",
    "Associate")
- Standardize department and function terms (e.g.,
    "Marketing",
    "Engineering")
- Examples:
  - "Marketing Manager" and "Manager, Marketing" → "Marketing Manager"
  - "Sr. Software Engineer" → "Senior Software Engineer"
  - "Associate Proj. Manager" → "Associate Project Manager"

### 3. Skills
- Group skills into a consistent taxonomy where applicable
- Standardize skill names (e.g., programming languages, tools, methodologies)
- Normalize skills with different specificity levels
- Examples:
  - "Salesforce.com" → "Salesforce"
  - Various strategy skills → categorize as subtypes of "Strategy" while preserving specificity
  - "Classroom Management" and "Class Management" → "Classroom Management"

### 4. Locations
- Format as "City, State/Province, Country" where possible
- Standardize country names and state/province abbreviations
- Replace regional descriptions with specific locations when clear
- Examples:
  - "Dallas, TX" → "Dallas, Texas, United States"
  - "Austin, Texas Area" → "Austin, Texas, United States"
  - "New York, New York, United States" → "New York, New York, United States" (already standard)

### 5. Dates
- Convert all dates to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) where full date is known
- Use YYYY-MM format for month-year combinations
- Maintain "Present" for current positions
- Examples:
  - "January 2020" → "2020-01"
  - "Jan 2020 - Present" → "2020-01" to "Present"
  - "01/2020" → "2020-01"

## Additional Guidelines
1. If a normalization would lose significant information, preserve the original form but standardize format
2. Create a \`normalization_notes\` field for any important changes or ambiguities
3. Ensure all changes maintain the semantic meaning of the original data
4. When unsure about a company name or specific terminology, use the most common standard form found in authoritative sources

## Expected Output
Return the complete normalized profile in valid JSON format matching the original schema, with all fields normalized according to these guidelines. Add the \`normalization_notes\` field at the root level of the JSON if needed.
